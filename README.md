Analysis of agricultural activities: geographical patterns 

Objectives: (1) Explore how agriculture practices have changed among regions; (2) How these practices are related with the geographical patterns of socio-economic indicators?

Data available: The available information are numbers per civil parishes. Proportions should be used to allow comparisons among regions (civil parishes, counties or districts).

Types of analysis (examples): statistical tests; correlations/regressions; classification or ordination techniques.

Visualizations (examples): Comparison visualizations; bivariate plots; multivariate analysis outputs (e.g. PCA biplots).
