# AVCAD Final Project

Analysis of agricultural activities: geographical patterns 

Objectives: (1) Explore how agriculture practices have changed among regions; (2) How these practices are related with the geographical patterns of socio-economic indicators?

Data available: The available information are numbers per civil parishes. Proportions should be used to allow comparisons among regions (civil parishes, counties or districts).

Types of analysis (examples): statistical tests; correlations/regressions; classification or ordination techniques.

Visualizations (examples): Comparison visualizations; bivariate plots; multivariate analysis outputs (e.g. PCA biplots).


## Goal
The main goal of the Data Visualization final project is to tell a coherent story from a complex agro-environmental dataset. 

## Work steps
Questions/hypothesis definition
Preparation of datasets, through database queries and data wrangling
Summary statistics
Exploratory data analysis
Inferential statistics 
Final visualisation product and storytelling

## Assessment
A live presentation of your story (it may consist on the planned work with a preliminary data exploratory analysis/description).
A short written report, including the code as an Appendix.

## Report
Should include the following chapters:
Introduction – Short introduction to the topic, ending with questions/working hypothesis to be addressed and objective (2 pages max.)
Database description – Short descriptive statistics of the database/tables (2 page max.)
Exploratory data analysis – This will be the most important chapter, where you will try to tell a coherent history by means of numerical outputs and visualizations (10 pages max.)
Discussion/Conclusions – a short discussion/main take home messages/conclusions of the work (2 pages max.).

ANNEX – Python code.
